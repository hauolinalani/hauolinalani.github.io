As developers, more often than not, we simply want to write our code, test it out, and see if it works. When it does work, we just want to move on and start iterating the next addition to our project. Don’t fix what isn’t broken right? The truth is, everyone's code gets a little sloppy. Working under pressure, completing an assignment too quickly, or even attempting to achieve a Rx time on a WOD can all contribute to an unorganized, difficult-to-read, jumbled mess that hinders our performance and code productivity as a whole. 

Although time-consuming without an integrated IDE extension, coding standards are crucial to software development for a variety of reasons. Think of books, articles, readings, and even this essay. Everything is structured according to its own standards: paragraphs, new lines, and gaps between paragraphs. It enables readers to read and grasp the text without exerting much effort. The same approach may be applied to coding standards, which determine the appearance of code, its maintainability, readability, and general functionality.

For starters, following coding standards ensures uniformity within a codebase by ensuring that all developers use the same conventions. Consistency is essential for understanding and maintaining code since it decreases cognitive load while reading and debugging. It allows developers to focus on issue solving rather than interpreting stylistic deviations by defining explicit norms for formatting, naming conventions, and code organization.

Moreover, coding standards facilitate collaboration among team members by providing a common language and framework for communication. When everyone follows the same set of standards, code reviews become more efficient and productive, as reviewers can quickly identify deviations from the established norms. Consistent coding practices also foster a sense of unity and cohesion within a team, promoting a shared understanding and appreciation for clean, readable code.

Beyond promoting consistency and collaboration, coding standards can serve as valuable learning tools for developers, especially those new to a programming language. By studying and adhering to established coding conventions, developers gain insight into best practices, idiomatic patterns, and language features. Consistent application of coding standards encourages developers to explore and internalize the nuances of a language, ultimately improving their proficiency and mastery.

As for my experience using ESLint with IntelliJ during my first week, I've found it to be both painful and useful in different ways. On one hand, striving to meet ESLint's standards and achieving the green checkmark can be challenging, especially when faced with unfamiliar rules or legacy codebases. However, this process forces me to scrutinize my code more closely, identify potential issues, and strive for cleaner, more consistent code. In this sense, ESLint serves as a valuable tool for continuous improvement, pushing me to adhere to coding standards and write better code over time.

In conclusion, coding standards are far from trivial—they are foundational principles that shape the quality and integrity of software. By promoting consistency, facilitating collaboration, and aiding learning, coding standards play a crucial role in driving excellence and professionalism in software development. Embracing coding standards not only benefits individual developers but also contributes to the overall success and sustainability of software projects.
