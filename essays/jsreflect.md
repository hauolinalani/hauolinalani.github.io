JavaScript has always been a language that I’ve struggled to completely grasp. 
Between the ability to change the type of a variable dynamically, and the vast amount of frameworks,
it keeps my brain always hungry to learn more, and to want to master this language in every aspect. 

I started my JavaScript journey a mere year ago and I remember thinking about how amazing it was
that you could make graphic computer designs actually have functions– I could make my cute little pink dropdown menu actually drop-down.
In reality, I was witnessing just how crucial JavaScript is for web development.
Once the hype of making my buttons “click” wore down, I quickly realized that JavaScript 
played a pivotal role in transforming static web pages into dynamic, interactive experiences. 
These websites weren’t just templates made through a fun editing program where you simply upload your pictures and type your content. 
They were hand-crafted in conjunction with HTML and CSS to design a platform that executed specific functions.

That same giddy feeling of seeing your designs literally come to life, still carries me through my journey in JavaScript 
and reminds me just how versatile this language is, and continues to be. Fast forward to the less, non-pink CSS objects,
JavaScript itself has proven to be a simple language to learn, at least in terms of syntax and entry-level concepts.
Concepts like closures, prototypes, and the event loop, while initially challenging, make it fun to learn and give me a
better understanding of JavaScript as a whole. This range allows JavaScript to cater to both beginners and seasoned developers 
which I think makes it a great language to learn, or at least dabble with in regard to Software Engineering.

Delving into ES6 was a challenge, to say the least. Gone were the pink buttons, and gone was my motivation to master JavaScript.
I will say, I can appreciate that it emphasizes modern features like arrow functions, template literals, 
and destructuring which enhance the language, but needless to say, they were difficult concepts for me to understand how to implement. 

My new discovery of Workout of the Day’s, or WODs, wasn’t exactly a pleasant experience for me either. 
I really struggled with the whole, “I’m on the clock” narrative and felt stressed the entire time.
I felt like I couldn’t remember any of my JavaScript skills and was completely dumbfounded by the prompts and problems.
It felt like centuries passed before I could actually get a line of code down. I do understand the reason of practicing the WODs, though. 
This concept of learning prepares us, as developers for real-world coding interviews where we most likely will need to perform under stress
and a pre determined amount of time, and in front of future employers, at that. The idea is that we learn not how to master the language itself,
but to know enough that we can solve problems given to us in a short amount of time. I don’t particularly fancy this style of learning, 
but I know it is necessary to be a great developer who can adjust to deadlines and embrace the stress while still producing quality work. 

Who knew my little pink dropdown menu would bring me here! I wouldn’t have ever imagined such a tiny object would push me
head first into the world of Web Development and more specifically, JavaScript. 
It has been nothing short of an adventure and I’m looking forward to mastering it through my educational endeavors. I'm so excited to learn more and cannot wait to report back soon with my findings!
