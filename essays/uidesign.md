I remember being in middle school and discovering “inspect element” on the drop down menu when right-clicking on a web page. I told all my friends about it and showed them how cool it was that you could temporarily change something on the screen– colors, fonts, numbers, names– as long as you could find the element you wanted to change, you could fiddle with it and experiment how you could change something on a page easily. I hadn’t known it at the time, but this was my first time dabbling in “web development” and I had no idea just how much there was involved in building, designing, and maintaining websites. 

These last few weeks have been an amazing learning experience for me and have actually pushed me to consider taking the “front end” more seriously. In all honesty, I didn’t quite grasp how people made careers out of web development when there are pre-made website creators and templates that design these things for you. Needless to say, I really enjoyed learning about the complexities of web design and development and how to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS in conjunction with each other to create intricate layouts, designs, and user interfaces while also providing functionality and a way for these 3 to interact with each other. 

At first, everything was really confusing, as it is learning anything code-related, if we’re being honest. I didn’t understand how to integrate CSS into HTML, using <style>, how to change the font, how to wrap images, where to call Bootstrap in the HTML file, etc. Navigating through these things were difficult, especially when switching between front-end and back-end tasks frequently. Using Bootstrap 5 made this entirely easier– no more browser issues, predefined classes, automatic adjustment of screen size, built-in icons, and integration with JavaScript plugins. I particularly enjoy that Bootstrap elements are usually defined within the code as their actual names: for example, when working on our Island Snow website clone, the icons we used were literally called their own names– Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. It makes it so much easier to understand what the code is calling and doing rather than going back and forth trying to figure out what lines of code specifically do what.The navigation bar is called nav-bar, the columns are called col, everything is just much easier to navigate in HTML and especially under direction of Bootstrap 5. It’s also really time-saving that their API gives you everything you need, easy to find, and guides you through using Bootstrap, so it’s never really overwhelming, unless you’re doing a timed WOD, of course. 

Speaking of WODs, I did get really frustrated on our most recent Murphys website clone because I couldn’t figure out how to move my navigation bar to the top right corner of my screen instead of it being on the left. Using containers didn’t work, columns, padding, length width height etc. I got really overwhelmed with it and I had the same issue when trying to wrap the pictures in the Browser History wod. These are just minute problems I need to work on though, and regardless, I still found that working through these design issues were much easier than debugging tons of lines of Python, or JavaScript, for example. 

Overall, my journey in UI design has been a memorable, yet challenging experience, combined with curiosity, challenges, and growth. From my middle school self tweaking elements on webpages to navigating the complexities of front-end development, every step of this journey has been filled with valuable lessons and insights. Embracing tools like Bootstrap has not only simplified the development process but has also empowered me to create visually stunning and user-friendly interfaces with purpose. I'm satisfied with my journey so far and also intrigued by the endless possibilities in the ever-evolving world of UI design, and cannot wait for new projects and challenges.
